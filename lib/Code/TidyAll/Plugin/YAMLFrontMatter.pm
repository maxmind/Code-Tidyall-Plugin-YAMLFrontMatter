# ABSTRACT: TidyAll plugin for validating YAML Front Matter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your .tidyallrc file:

    [YAMLFrontMatter]
    select = **/*.md
    required_top_level_keys = title layout

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a validator plugin for L<Code::TidyAll> that can be used to check
that files have valid YAML Front Matter, like Jekyll et al use.

It will complain if:

=over

=item There's no YAML Front Matter

=item The YAML Front Matter isn't valid YAML

=item There's a UTF-8 BOM at the start of the file

=item The file isn't encoded in the configured encoding (UTF-8 by default)

=item The YAML Front Matter is missing one or more configured top level keys

=item The YAML Front Matter contains circular references

=back

=head2 Options

=over

=item C<required_top_level_keys>

Keys that must be present at the top level of the YAML Front Matter.

=item C<encoding>

The encoding the file is in.  Defaults to UTF-8 (just like Jekyll 2.0 and
later.)

=back
